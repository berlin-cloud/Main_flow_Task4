# 🏡 House Price Prediction - Regression Analysis  

## 📌 Overview  
This project is part of my **Data Science with Python** internship at **Main Flow Services and Technologies Pvt. Ltd.** The goal is to build a **linear regression model** to predict house prices based on features like **size, location, and number of rooms**.  

## 🚀 Project Workflow  
1️⃣ **Data Preprocessing**  
   - Handle missing values & outliers  
   - Normalize numerical data (Min-Max Scaling)  
   - Encode categorical features (One-Hot Encoding)  

2️⃣ **Feature Selection**  
   - Correlation analysis to identify impactful predictors  
   - Remove low-impact features  

3️⃣ **Model Training**  
   - Train-Test split (80% train, 20% test)  
   - Train a **Linear Regression Model** using `scikit-learn`  

4️⃣ **Model Evaluation**  
   - Evaluate performance using **RMSE** & **R² Score**  
   - Analyze feature importance  

## 📊 Key Insights  
✅ **Size and number of rooms** strongly influence house prices  
✅ **Location plays a significant role** in price variations  
✅ The model provides **real-world price estimations**, but optimization is ongoing
